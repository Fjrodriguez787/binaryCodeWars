Sum all the numbers of the array (in F# and Haskell you get a list) except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
(The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)



function sumArray(array) {
  return !array || array.length == 0 ? 0 : array.sort((a, b) => a - b).slice(1, array.length - 1).reduce((res, n) => res + n,0);
}
